Capomulin and Ramicane were documented to be the top two drugs administered to the mice population. They were also the most effective on average compared to 
Infubinol and Ceftamin with having smaller tumors at the end of the regimens.

With regards to Capomulin, the heavier the mouse, the larger the tumor volume was, due to a linear regession analysis comparing weight and tumor volume.
A correlation coefficient of 0.84 showed how closely weight and tumor volume affected each other.

Capomulin treatment generally had a profound effect on tumor volume change. Volume would increase for at most 20 days at a time and then begin to decrease. 
Other treatments using the other drugs such as Infubinol had little to no effect on tumor growth.
